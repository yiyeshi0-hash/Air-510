# Launch the game into the benchmark world and leave it running (for profiling
# or ad-hoc probing). Handles the flaky-launch failure mode seen on Odin Lite:
# the JVM occasionally dies with "exited due to signal 34" right after
# JLI_Launch (~40% of launches, cause unknown) — so launching retries up to
# --retries times before giving up.
#
# Usage: session.sh --device devices/odinlite.env [--backend magma|espryt|mobileglues]
#                   [--settle 150] [--retries 3] [--no-pin]
#                   [--allow-unverified-profile]
# Exits 0 with the game in-world (after settle seconds), 1 otherwise.
# NOTE: leaves the game running AND the frequency pins active (that is the
# point of a session). When done: am force-stop the game and unpin via
# `echo <cluster> -1 > /proc/ppm/policy/hard_userlimit_{min,max}_cpu_freq`
# and `echo 0 > /proc/gpufreq/gpufreq_opp_freq` (or run a bench.sh, whose
# cleanup unpins).

# Remembered BEFORE the cd, so a --device path written relative to the caller's directory still

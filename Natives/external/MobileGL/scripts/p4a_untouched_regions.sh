# G5's gate for P4a: the Espryt do-not-touch list is LITERAL - SEVENTEEN regions across THREE
# files stay byte-identical after P4a.
#
# WHAT G5 CLAIMS, and why a diff of the files cannot say it. ARCHITECTURE.md:318 is the Espryt
# do-not-touch list and :321 names the ONE item moved out of it (the sub-rect upload decision and
# the stride computation, which is P4a's D-D3/D-D6 subject). P3a made the buffer half of that list
# literal with a sha gate over eleven functions in Managers.cpp (scripts/p3a_untouched_regions.sh);
# P4a rewrites the rest of Managers.cpp, DirectGLES.cpp and Utils.cpp by design - the twins become
# handle-shaped, the descriptors replace the frontend reads - so the files' diffs are large and say
# nothing about whether the ring, the permutation, the depth/stencil sampling core or the format
# caveat moved. This gate extracts the seventeen BODIES and compares them on their own.
#
# THE SEVENTEEN. P3a's eleven are carried forward unchanged (BRIEF-P4A.md D-N: "P4a must not touch
# any of the eleven"), so this script is a superset of its parent and the two run side by side -
# the parent keeps answering P3a's question against P3a's base ref, this one answers P4a's.

#                                  allocated as
#
# TWO THINGS THIS SCRIPT ADDS TO ITS PARENT, AND NOTHING ELSE (BRIEF-P4A.md D-N: "keeps every other
# property of its parent verbatim"):
#
#   1. A PER-REGION SOURCE PATH. The parent's SOURCE_PATH is a single file (:85); the seventeen live
#      in three. Each row below carries its own path and the extractor reads each file once.
#   2. A REGION KIND. [declared deviation, see DEVIATIONS below] Sixteen of the seventeen are
#      FUNCTIONS. `DepthStencilSamplingReadImpl` is a NAMESPACE (DirectGLES.cpp:8117-8578) - the
#      brief's D-N table names it as though it were a function, and the parent's extractor, which
#      finds a definition as the one `<name> (` whose closing paren is followed by `{`, finds ZERO
#      definitions of it and exits 2 forever. Hashing the whole namespace block is also the
#      stronger reading of "the D24S8 sampling-emulation CORE": the core is the ~460-line block of
#      staging, conversion and readback, not any one function inside it.
#
# Everything else is the parent verbatim, and deliberately so:
#
# HOW A BODY IS EXTRACTED. The file is masked first - comments, string, char and raw-string
# literals are replaced by spaces of the same length, so a brace or a parenthesis inside one can
# never be counted - and the DEFINITION is then found as the one occurrence of `<name> (` whose
# closing parenthesis is followed (past qualifiers like const/noexcept) by `{`. That is what tells
# a definition from a forward declaration and from a call site: a call's `)` is followed by `)`,
# `;` or `,`, never by `{`. A NAMESPACE row is found as the one occurrence of `namespace <name>`
# followed by `{`. The body is then brace matched in the masked text and hashed from the ORIGINAL
# text, so a comment change inside one of these is a difference too - which is deliberate: the
# claim is "byte-identical", and a comment that stopped describing what the code does is exactly
# the kind of drift a "verbatim move" is supposed to be checked for.
#
# THE HASH'S EXACT EXTENT, so that the claim is not read wider than it is (review F-m3, inherited
# from the parent verbatim): it starts at the beginning of the LINE THAT CARRIES THE NAME and ends
# at the region's closing brace. A return type, an attribute or a template header sitting on an
# EARLIER line of a multi-line signature is therefore OUTSIDE the hash, and changing one of those
# alone does not move this gate. The end IS covered - the self-test's tail controls below prove
# the extent reaches the closing brace - and G1's symbol report is what catches a signature that
# changed shape.
#
# Exactly one definition must be found per name. Zero or two is exit 2 (could not run), never a
# silent pass: a rename this gate could not follow must not read as "nothing moved". Two is the
# expected shape of a #if/#else pair that re-spells one of these bodies beside an untouched copy -
# a finding, not a limitation, because two ladders drift (ID-11, ID-15).
#
# A SHARED TEMPLATE OVER AN ACCESSOR INTERFACE IS REJECTED (ID-13, MEASUREMENTS.md:521): it resizes
# pull symbols and breaks G1. If a P4a arm needs a variant of one of the seventeen it gets its own
# `#if MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH` function with its own name and its own pinned sha - the
# FlushPendingRangesFrom shape.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/p4a_untouched_regions.sh <ref-a> <ref-b>   compare the seventeen at two git refs
#   scripts/p4a_untouched_regions.sh <ref>             print the seventeen shas at one ref (a
#                                                      baseline capture: ... > p4a-before.sha)
#   scripts/p4a_untouched_regions.sh --self-test       prove the comparison can go red
#
# stdout is always the sha list - `<sha256>  <region>`, one per line, in the fixed order above - so
# a baseline capture is a plain redirect. Everything else goes to stderr.
#
# Both arguments are GIT REFS: the gate is about what landed, so an uncommitted edit is invisible
# by design. Use HEAD after committing, which is what D.1 and the CI row do.
#
# Exit codes: 0 the seventeen are identical at both refs (or a single ref was listed);
#             1 at least one moved - the first one in the fixed order is named on stderr;
#             2 the gate could not run: a bad ref, a missing file, a name that is not defined
#               exactly once, or a self-test whose control failed to trip.
#
# DEVIATIONS from BRIEF-P4A.md D-N, both declared here rather than in a commit message so that the
# next reader of this file meets them:
#   D-N/1  the namespace region kind, above.
#   D-N/2  the PINNED baseline is CONSULTED UNCONDITIONALLY for FlushPendingRangesFrom, where the
#          parent consulted it only when <ref-a> did not define the function. D-N says that row is
#          compared "against its pinned sha", and at P4a's base ref the function DOES exist - so
#          the parent's fallback would silently never fire and the pin would stop being the
#          baseline the brief names. INTEGRATOR DECISION ID-41 has since made this the parent's
#          reading too, so D-N/2 is no longer a deviation between the two scripts; it is kept here
#          as the record of why this one got there first.
#
#          The two answers now DISAGREE on every ref CI passes, and that is the expected state
#          rather than a finding: P5 (b1) re-parameterised the shipping ladder
#          (hostBaseFrom/hostBaseTo, a MOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY-only StageSnapshotTooNarrow log, the
#          tier-1 access computation moved into InvalidateFlushAccessFor), the PULL arm is
#          byte-identical across that change and G1 reports .text +0, and ID-41 ruled that the row
#          be RE-PINNED on the reviewed P5 body rather than reverted or quietly left comparing
#          against <ref-a>. This script says so on stderr, in both directions, and keeps the PIN -
#          because the pin is the reviewed text.
set -u -o pipefail

# One row per region: <name>@<kind>@<path>. The ORDER is the fixed order the sha list is printed
# in and the order `compare_lists` names the first mover from; P3a's eleven keep their parent's
# positions so a reader can diff the two scripts' outputs.

# G7's negative control for P3a: drop one field from the vertex-input wire conversion on purpose
# and prove the emission-consistency suite says so, naming the field.
#
# WHAT G6 CLAIMS. For every VAO configuration the client's emitted MGPVertexElements blob +
# MGPVertexBuffers set + MGPIndexBuffer reproduce EXACTLY the values
# BackendVertexArrayObject::SyncToBackend reads from the frontend today, field by field, for all 32
# attribute slots. MG_Test/Pipe/VertexInputEmitTest.cpp (suite `VertexInputEmit`) is what walks it.
#
# WHY A CONTROL IS NEEDED AT ALL. That suite is green on a correct conversion, and it would be just
# as green on a conversion it had stopped looking at: a walk that drove no configurations, a
# comparison that stopped reading the blob, an assertion someone loosened. Green says nothing about
# whether the suite can still fail. This script makes it fail, for the one reason it exists to
# catch, and reports a NON-ZERO ctest THAT NAMES THE DROPPED FIELD as the pass.
#
# THE BREAK. `IsBgra` stops being copied into MGPVertexAttribWire. It is deliberately a break the
# COMPILER CANNOT SEE: the struct still has the member, MGPVertexAttribWire is still 24 bytes, its
# four static_asserts in MGPipeValueTypes.h's trip-wire block still hold, the field list in
# PipeFields.def still names it and the generated comparator still compares it. What breaks is the
# VALUE - the wire record now says "not BGRA" for a GL_BGRA attribute, which is the shape that made
# a swizzled colour array read back with its channels in driver order. It is also the field with
# the least other coverage: `Size` keeps 4 for GL_BGRA (D-G2), so a dropped IsBgra does not even
# change the attribute's size.
#
# The patch is applied by REGEX rather than by an exact line, because MG_Impl/Pipe/VertexInputEmit.h
# is package B's file and its spelling is B's to choose: any `<something>.IsBgra = <expr>;` (or the
# designated-initializer `.IsBgra = <expr>,`) has its right-hand side replaced by 0. If the header
# does not assign the field at all - because it has not landed yet, or because the conversion is
# spelled some other way - that is exit 2, "could not run", never a pass.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT A CI LANE. It rebuilds the library twice. It is run by hand, and by the integrator
# at the P3a five-part gate (D.3, beside P2's g7_negative_control.sh).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/p3a_vertex_input_negative_control.sh <build-dir>
#
#   <build-dir>   a configured build directory carrying the push-only unit suites
#                 (VertexInputEmit's emission cases are compiled only under MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH)
#
# RESTORE IS NOT ENOUGH; THE REBUILD IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. Once the header has been patched,
# EVERY way out of this script goes through repair(): restore the header, rebuild the library from
# it, and re-run the suite to prove the tree really went back. `cp` alone leaves <build-dir> holding
# a libMobileGL.so in which IsBgra is hard-zeroed, `ctest` does not rebuild, and nothing in an exit
# status tells a caller to. The path that needs this most is the one that reads "NEGATIVE CONTROL
# DID NOT TRIP": an engineer reacts to it by opening the suite and re-running ctest against this
# very build directory, and every reading they take there would come from a deliberately corrupted
# library. Leaving a build directory holding the broken header is worse than any exit status, so
# repair() runs from the EXIT trap as well - a mid-way failure (the patched header would not
# compile, an interrupt) repairs too - and a repair that itself fails downgrades the verdict to 2.
#
# Nothing is written into the repository. Logs and the header backup live in
# <build-dir>/p3a-g7-logs/, which is inside the build tree and therefore neither committed nor
# picked up by `git status`; the paths are printed with every verdict.
#
# Exit codes: 0 the control tripped AND named IsBgra;
#             1 the control did not answer: either the suite stayed green with the field dropped,
#               or it went red without ever naming IsBgra, so the red cannot be attributed to the
#               dropped field. Both are findings about the TEST, not errors in this script - and
#               both leave the tree restored AND rebuilt AND re-run;
#             2 the script could not run the control at all (bad arguments; the header or the
#               field is absent on this tree; no matching test; a build that was already broken;
#               the patched header did not compile; a failed restore or a failed rebuild after
#               one).

// Scenario - THE P3a SUBSYSTEM A/B IS REAL (gate G12).
//
// P3a migrates two subsystems: kMGPipeSubsystemResources (bit 7, the resource_* family) and
// kMGPipeSubsystemVertexInput (bit 8, vertex elements / buffers / index). The push build's default
// mask becomes kMGPipeSubsystemsMigratedAtP3a = 0x1ff, and P2's 0x7f survives as the control that
// clears exactly those two bits - MGPipe.h:79's rule that every phase's constant keeps meaning what
// it meant, so an operator's recorded mask is still readable a phase later.
//
// That A/B is what every "push vs pull" number in MEASUREMENTS.md is taken against, and it has one
// characteristic failure mode: the bits stop steering anything, both arms run the same code, and
// every later comparison is quietly taken against a switch that does nothing. This file is the
// entry that cannot let that happen.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, per arm:
//
//   on  (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x1ff)
//       The client emits map_persistent for every definition of a store past
//       BufferObject::TryAdoptLargeStorage's 16 MiB threshold, so the window's
//       map-persistent-roundtrips (`mpr=`) equals the number of definitions in it - one per
//       storage definition, mint or decline (D-B2).
//
//   off (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x7f, P2's default = P3a's subsystems cleared)
//       The frontend dispatch falls through to the legacy BufferBackendOps arm, nothing is emitted
//       through the resource family, and mpr= must read ZERO. This is the reading a dead switch
//       fails: with bit 7 ignored, this arm would report the same non-zero count as the other one.
//
//   both arms
//       THE PIXELS MUST NOT MOVE. The arena is filled with one solid-colour quad and drawn, and
//       both arms must read back that colour. "The counters moved and the picture did not" is the
//       whole claim - a switch that changed what is drawn would not be an A/B, it would be a bug.
//
// WHY IT CAN SKIP. The counter is emitted by the client-side resource tracker (P3a package B), and
// this file is written against the P3a contract commit, before that package lands. Until then
// nothing emits map_persistent, mpr= is structurally zero in BOTH arms, and an assertion about the
// difference would be a statement about nothing. The build answers the question rather than a
// hand-maintained list: MG_IntegrationTest/CMakeLists.txt greps every source under MG_Impl/Pipe/
// for the counter's name and passes the answer in as MGITEST_PIPE_RESOURCE_EMITTER_PRESENT, with a
// CONFIGURE_DEPENDS on that directory and on each file it finds so the answer cannot go stale. It
// is a CONTENT probe, not a filename probe, so the owning package keeps control of its own file
// layout - P3a's new client files are headers (D-N), and a glob for `ResourceTracker.cpp` would
// have kept this control skipping forever with a reason that had become false.
//
// DirectGLES ONLY, and that is the honest scope: P3a migrates Espryt's buffer and VAO paths.
// Magma's buffer path is P7 and registers no MGPipeResourceOps, so a DirectVulkan lane here would
// be measuring the client emitter against a backend that has not been asked to change - which is
// a real question, but it is P7's, not this control's.

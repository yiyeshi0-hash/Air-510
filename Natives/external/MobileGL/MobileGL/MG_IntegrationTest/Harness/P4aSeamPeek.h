// The three readings P4aSeamAuditScenario.cpp takes from the inside, for the two seams the fable
// seam audit proved that PUBLIC GL CANNOT SEE: F-4 (the record arm's sampler bind is a permanent
// no-op, hidden by the pre-handle program pass binding the same values) and F-2 / SD-4 (the
// shader-image window does not follow a program switch, hidden by the server's window/high-water
// union taking the pre-handle bind for the units outside it). Both are correct pictures over a
// permanent silent fallback, which is precisely the class ROADMAP.md:20 says a gate has to be
// able to make red - and the only place the difference exists is inside.
//
// A SEPARATE TRANSLATION UNIT for PipeApplyPeek.h's reason, verbatim: this file includes
// Espryt's own Managers.h, which may not meet a scenario's GL headers in one file. It is NOT
// PipeApplyPeek.cpp because that file is package F's (gates v3) and this round may not edit it.
//
// EVERY ENTRY POINT RETURNS false, TOUCHING NOTHING, WHERE IT CANNOT LOOK - a pull build, Android,
// a backend that is not Espryt - and a caller that gets false has learned NOTHING: "could not
// look" is not "was bound". The scenario declines the reading BY NAME and keeps its public-GL
// half, which is the shape TextureParamsWithoutASamplerViewScenario.cpp argues for.

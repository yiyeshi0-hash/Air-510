// The white-box readings P4aFinalFixScenario.cpp takes, in a translation unit of their own for
// P4aSeamPeek.h's reason: a scenario TU includes the GL prototype headers and cannot include
// MG_Pipe/PipeApply.h or the Espryt managers beside them, and PipeApplyPeek.cpp is the gates
// package's file. Every entry point answers false where the reading cannot be taken (a pull
// build, Android, or an applier that holds no record for the name), and a false teaches the
// caller nothing - the case declines that half by name and keeps its public-GL verdict.

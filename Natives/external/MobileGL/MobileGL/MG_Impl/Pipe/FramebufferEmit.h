// The CLIENT side of P4a's framebuffer family: set_framebuffer_state, emitted at the validate
// point once per bound TARGET that moved, or once with Target = Both when the two bindings
// name the same object.
//
// THIS FILE IS CREATED BY THE CONTRACT COMMIT AND FILLED BY THE PACKAGE THAT OWNS IT, and the
// split is the whole reason it exists this early. MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp is the contract
// package's for the entire phase - it carries Coverage.def's enum-coupled block, the validate
// point and the death helpers - so the emitter package must not edit it. What it edits instead
// is this header: the emitter's BODY, and the value of kMGPipeWiredFramebufferSubsystem below.
// That is what makes "no file is touched twice by two packages" structural rather than a
// convention, and it is what the bb2a236d semantic-merge trap taught (two branches green
// separately, the integrated tree not compiling).
//
// HEADER-ONLY, for the ownership reason Tracker.h and ResourceTracker.h both state: the root
// CMakeLists.txt that would name a new .cpp is the contract package's and is frozen behind the
// tag. MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp is the one translation unit that includes it in the library.

    // handles and a fully resolved descriptor. So this bit switches the EMISSION on and the

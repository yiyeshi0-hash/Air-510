// The CLIENT side of P4a's sampler family: the content-addressed sampler CSO cache, the
// identity-addressed sampler view per texture object, and the two unit sets
// set_sampler_views and bind_sampler_states. The third unit set, set_shader_images, is
// ImageEmit.h's - the same subsystem bit, a different resolution.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS FILE OWNS THAT ARE EASY TO GET WRONG, both stated where the body will go:
//   * SamplerParameters is 100 bytes with THREE BYTES OF TRAILING PADDING, so the CSO cache
//     hashes and memcmp-confirms over a ZERO-INITIALISED canonical copy built field by field,
//     never over the object's own bytes. Without that the 256-entry cache's hit rate is zero
//     and nobody notices, because the pixels are right.
//   * every emission goes through a VERSION-FIRST SKIP before it hashes anything: the sampler
//     view latches (params version, shape version) per handle, and the two sets latch their
//     SetHashSuppressor slots. A 192-entry walk per verb without a latch is not affordable.
//
// THIS FILE IS CREATED BY THE CONTRACT COMMIT AND FILLED BY THE PACKAGE THAT OWNS IT - see
// FramebufferEmit.h for why, in full. kMGPipeWiredSamplerSubsystem below covers this file AND
// ImageEmit.h: the three unit sets, the sampler CSO and the sampler view are ONE family and
// one subsystem bit, because an operator switching samplers off has to get the whole family's
// legacy arm rather than two thirds of it.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS THE CLIENT HALF OF, named so a reader can check it against the oracle:
// DirectGLES' ResolveAndBindUnitTextures (the per-unit sampler-view resolution),
// BindCurrentUnitSamplers (the per-unit sampler-object walk) and the program pass' sampler
// override. TWO BACKEND POST-PROCESSINGS DELIBERATELY STAY ON THE SERVER and act on the
// RESOLVED set: Espryt's raw-depth-fetch sampler substitution and Magma's feedback-loop
// detection. Neither is reproduced here and neither may be.
//
// HEADER-ONLY, for the ownership reason Tracker.h and ResourceTracker.h both state.

    // WIRED. The sampler CSO, the sampler view and all three unit sets - set_shader_images
    // included, whose emitter lives in ImageEmit.h - have bodies, so this file's family
    // contributes its bit to kMGPipeWiredSubsystems. ONE bit for the whole family, because an
    // operator switching samplers off has to get the whole family's legacy arm rather than two
    // thirds of it.
    //
    // WHAT THE BIT DOES, and it really is a gate - c0b changed this and the note that used to
    // say the opposite was true only against the contract commit. The validate point's
    // `wants()` (PipeFill.cpp) now asks FOUR things: the bit maps to a subsystem, the
    // operator's MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH mask carries it, `kMGPipeWiredSubsystems` carries it -
    // i.e. this constant is non-zero - and the dirty bit fired. The birth hooks' own gate
    // (`FamilyIsLive`) is the same pair one level in, so the client paths and the validate
    // point cannot disagree. So an emitter with a body and this constant still 0 is called by
    // nothing and emits nothing, and flipping the constant is what switches the family on.
    //
    // IT IS ALSO A COMPILE-TIME CONTRACT. While it is non-zero, PipeFill.cpp's `if constexpr`
    // seam instantiates the forward to this family's entry points - EmitSamplerCso and
    // EmitSamplerView below - so a missing or misspelled one is a build error in this file's
    // own commit rather than a surprise at the merge.
    //
    // The A/B that switches this family off at RUNTIME is still the mask; this constant is
    // what a build declares it emits for, and it feeds EmittedCallSuppliesTheWholeField's
    // guard. ONE bit for the whole family, for the reason above.

    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // sizeof(SamplerParameters) == 100 and its members occupy 97 of those bytes: six 4-byte
    // enums, four Floats, two more 4-byte enums, three 16-byte colour vectors and the one-byte
    // borderColorForm. Bytes 97, 98 and 99 are PADDING and no writer ever touches them.
    //
    // A cache that hashed or memcmp'd the object's own bytes would therefore read
    // uninitialised memory. In practice SamplerObject value-initialises its member and never
    // rewrites it, so in practice those bytes are stable - and "in practice" is not a
    // contract. The whole point of a content-addressed cache is that a false MISS mints a
    // fresh CSO per call: a 256-entry cache with a hit rate of zero, on a path nobody looks
    // at, because the pixels are right either way.
    //
    // So every hash and every confirm runs over a copy that is memset to zero FIRST and then
    // assigned field by field, which makes the padding deterministically zero on both sides of
    // the comparison. The field list is MGP_FIELDS_SamplerParameters', in its order, and the
    // verify build compares the same sixteen fields one at a time - without that
    // PipeFields.def row the blob would be compared as bytes and G4 would be a coin flip.
    //
    // ONE COPY PER MINT ATTEMPT, never per draw: the version-first skip in the two emitters
    // below decides whether to come here at all.
    // THE PRIMITIVE TAKES AN OUT-PARAMETER, and that is not a style preference either. A
    // returned SamplerParameters is copied, and a copy of a trivially copyable type leaves the
    // padding UNSPECIFIED - so a canonicaliser that returned by value would hand its caller a
    // value whose three trailing bytes are whatever the copy left there, which is the very
    // thing this function exists to make deterministic. Every producer of canonical bytes in

    // D-F1: the content-addressed sampler CSO cache, capacity 256
    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // Unlike P3a's vertex-elements CSO, content addressing is RIGHT here: a SamplerObject is a
    // pure 100-byte value with no driver-side per-object binding state, two identical samplers
    // can share one CSO with no extra work on either side, and Espryt's BackendSamplerObject
    // is a driver name plus a parameter shadow - nothing a second frontend object would have
    // to re-establish.
    //
    // THE LOOKUP IS CsoCache.h's, one for one: hash, probe, and CONFIRM WITH A MEMCMP before
    // reusing a handle, because a bare 64-bit equality would alias two different sampler
    // states onto one CSO and that is silent wrong filtering with no gate that can see it.
    //
    // WHAT KEEPS A LIVE HANDLE OUT OF THE LRU's REACH IS A REFERENCE COUNT, not the capacity
    // (ID-17). The capacity argument - "one pass acquires at most kMGPipeMaxTextureUnits == 192
    // CSOs and touches every one of them, so LRU can only evict an entry from an EARLIER pass"
    // - closes the INTRA-PASS case only, and the case that matters is the other one: a
    // MGPTextureParams record published in an earlier pass names its texture's BuiltinSampler
    // for as long as that texture's parameters do not move, the applier deliberately does not
    // resolve that handle, and an eviction is not a parameter change, so nothing re-emits and
    // nobody refuses. With more than 256 distinct live sampler values - a CTS sampler sweep, a
    // scene with many filter/wrap/border combinations - the rarely-touched built-in samplers
    // are the FIRST victims.
    //
    // So every Acquire takes a REFERENCE and Release drops one; LRU considers only entries
    // whose count is 0; and when every entry is pinned the cache MINTS BEYOND CAPACITY and
    // counts it (Counters::OverCapacityMints). Growing is the safe direction - a slot too many
    // costs memory, a handle pulled out from under a live record costs correctness - and the
    // count is a recorded number rather than a gate, so a workload that pins more than 256
    // values is visible instead of being wrong.
    //
    // WHO HOLDS A REFERENCE: package B's EmitTextureParams for a texture's built-in sampler
    // (released when the texture dies or when a parameter change makes it re-acquire), and
    // this file's own bind_sampler_states for every CSO a unit is currently bound to. Anything
    // that acquires a handle it will still name after it returns must hold one.
    //
    // THE CAPACITY ITSELF IS STILL A SIZING BOUND worth asserting: a cache that could not hold
    // one whole emission pass would over-capacity-mint on every single pass, which is a
    // silently unbounded cache rather than a 256-entry one.
    //
    // THE SLOT IS ALLOCATED WITHOUT A LIFETIME ID, deliberately: a content-addressed CSO
    // belongs to a VALUE and not to a frontend object, so ~SamplerObject must not free it -
    // another live SamplerObject may hold the same value. MGPipeEmitSamplerCsoDestroyAndFree
    // resolves nothing for such an id and correctly frees nothing; the only death path for
    // these slots is the LRU eviction below, which is client-side and therefore
    // backend-neutral on day one.
    //
    // PACKAGE D MUST BE TOLD, and it is the one consequence of that choice that reaches the
    // server: NotifyStateObjectDestroyed(SamplerCso, lifetimeId) arrives from ~SamplerObject
    // with NO HANDLE BEHIND IT, every time. A backend must NOT key a sampler twin on a

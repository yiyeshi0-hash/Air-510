// The CLIENT side of set_shader_images, the third of P4a's kVarTail unit sets. It rides
// SamplerEmit.h's subsystem bit (kMGPipeWiredSamplerSubsystem): one family, one A/B.
//
// TWO INVARIANTS THAT MUST SURVIVE INTO THE BODY, and they are the kind an optimisation
// deletes:
//   1. THE HIGH-WATER-ZERO EARLY-OUT. An image high-water mark of 0 emits nothing, BEFORE any
//      hash - that is what makes every Minecraft draw pay one integer test for a feature it
//      does not use.
//   2. THE SWEEP'S GATE IS KEYED ON FRONTEND GENERATIONS AND DELIBERATELY NOT ON A BACKEND
//      RE-MINT COUNTER. A texture bound ONLY to an image unit is re-minted INSIDE the sweep,
//      so a server-side epoch would be bumped after the gate had already declined. The
//      client's bit-14 shutter is Mix(Mix(textureContent, textureParams), programImageUnitVersion)
//      - all three FRONTEND counters - so the property is preserved by construction, and it is
//      written here because it is invisible from the shutter itself.
//
// The record carries the APPLICATION's format and access; the bind-format recast (a GL_RG32F
// bind is INVALID_VALUE on 19 of 26 non-core formats on Adreno) and the buffer-texture split
// view stay SERVER-side and unchanged. ContentHash therefore has to cover InternalFormat and
// Access as well as the binding, because the format the shader was built against is live
// glBindImageTexture state and the format-less image bake keys on it.
//
// THIS FILE IS CREATED BY THE CONTRACT COMMIT AND FILLED BY THE PACKAGE THAT OWNS IT - see
// FramebufferEmit.h for why, in full.

        //
        // AND IT IS STILL NOT TextureState's MARK, EVEN THOUGH ONE NOW EXISTS. P5d round 3
        // (package C) added TextureState::NoteImageUnitTouched - a push-build-only image-unit
        // high-water mark, fed by glBindImageTexture - for the split client's per-draw
        // GPU-write sweep. That mark answers "which units could hold a binding"; the window
        // below answers the strictly narrower "which units could a SHADER READ", which is what
        // makes the zero early-out fire for an application that binds an image no shader names.

        // compiled only into push builds, where the object is already a different size.

        // unit can matter at all: the highest image unit the CURRENT PROGRAM names, memoised
        // per program state in SamplerEmit.h's shared inversion, UNIONED with a sticky mark of

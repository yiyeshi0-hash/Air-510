// Coalescing rule 4 (ARCHITECTURE.md 5.4, P2 brief D11): every kVarTail set_* hashes the
// RESOLVED set on the client and does not emit when the hash has not moved.
//
// This is the carrier for the ~175 lines of debounce that move off the backends in P3b and
// P4b - Espryt's UnitBindingsSnapshot / CaptureUnitBindings / UnitBindingsUnchanged and
// Magma's equivalents all answer "is this set the same set as last time", and every one of
// them answers it against a shape the backend rediscovered. P2 lands the MECHANISM and ONE
// real consumer (SetVertexAttribDefaults) so the shape is pinned by a test rather than by a
// plan; the other six slots exist, are unit-tested, and are wired by the phase that moves
// the set they name. P3a wires the second, SetVertexBuffers. P4a wires SetSamplerViews,
// BindSamplerStates and SetShaderImages, and APPENDS an eighth slot, SetFramebufferState -
// which leaves only SetShaderBuffers and SetStreamOutputTargets unwired, both P4b's.
//
// A WIRED SLOT PUTS A REQUIREMENT ON ITS HASH, and SetVertexBuffers is where that first
// bites: the hash has to cover EVERY input the record carries, not only the set. Its
// baseInstance is DRAW state and moves without the buffer set moving, so a hash over the
// entries alone would suppress a record whose one changed field is the fetch shift and the
// server would keep the previous one. MG_Impl/Pipe/VertexInputEmit.h's
// MGPipeVertexBufferSetContentHash mixes Start, Count and BaseInstance in for exactly that
// reason, and VertexInputEmit's base-instance pair is the test that says so.
//
// A hash of 0 is reserved for "never emitted", so the first emission always goes out; a
// computed 0 is remapped to 1, which costs one collision in 2^64 an extra emission and
// never a missed one.
//
// Header-only for the same ownership reason as Tracker.h and CsoCache.h: the root
// CMakeLists.txt that would name a new .cpp belongs to package A and is frozen behind the
// p2/contract tag.

// THE CLIENT ARM OF R-17's ROUTING: the encode twin of `gMGPipeWireRecordApply`. Owner: c1.
//
// Thirty-eight thin emitters over `ClientSession::EmitAndWait`, installed over the two
// generated tables and the escape table that `MG_Pipe/PipeRoute.h` declares, so that under
// split every resource, CSO, texture and program record leaves the GL thread as a WIRE RECORD
// instead of executing synchronously against a context the apply thread now owns.
//
// WHAT ARMS `integration-split`. The 21 `DirectGLES.Split.*` entries skip on
// `ClientSession::Active() == nullptr`. `Install()` below is called from the END of a
// successful `ClientSession::Start()`, on the GL thread (the thread that called
// `MG_Backend::Init()`), AFTER the Hello/Welcome handshake, after the first CapsSnapshot has
// been adopted, and after the in-process server role's apply thread has been started. That
// order is not a preference:
//   - after the handshake, because an emitter that published before Welcome would be writing
//     into a ring the peer has not mapped;
//   - after the first snapshot, because R-8's liveness gates read the caps mirror and a
//     placeholder mirror consumes nothing, so a record emitted before it would be emitted to a
//     server this client has not yet been told consumes that family;
//   - after the apply thread exists, because `EmitAndWait` BLOCKS on `appliedSeq` and nothing
//     would advance it - a barrier wait with no applier is the 30-second Fatal, not a hang;
//   - on the GL thread, because that is the only thread that may touch `gPipeInputs` while the
//     barrier holds (table 3), and installing from the apply thread would publish the table to
//     the GL thread with no synchronisation at all.
// `Uninstall()` runs at the TOP of `Stop()`, before the rings go away, so the last thing any
// straggling GL-thread call reaches is a named refusal rather than a dangling session.

    // WHAT IT IS NOT (M7, corrected). This is NOT what arms the split lane. WireTables.h round 2
    // claimed it was "t1's FOURTH arming fact", and that was wrong: the harness reads the
    // encoder's EmitSeq (Harness/SplitRuntimePeek.cpp:50, Harness/ScenarioFixture.h:85), which
    // moves for the class-B verbs too. So an armed Clear-only lane is green on EmitSeq while this
    // counter stays 0. Making the harness read THIS instead is t1's file (SplitRuntimePeek), so
    // the honest statement is the one here: c1 counts the routed ordinal at the only place that
    // can, PipeFill's InitialBytesNotCarried self-check reads it (PipeFill.cpp:755), and the
    // lane's own arming remains EmitSeq until t1 re-points it. c1-v3.md M7 has the full note.

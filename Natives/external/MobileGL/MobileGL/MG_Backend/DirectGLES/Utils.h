        // stages that use it differently land on different prefixes and cannot be merged at all.

        // the SAME image a distinct uniform in every stage that named it, and Adreno allocates
        // image LOCATIONS per distinct uniform. KHR-GL43.shading_language_420pack.
        // binding_images_texture_type_* declares three read+write images in each of its five

        // A declaration SPIRV-Cross already tagged `readonly` or `writeonly` needs no qualifier

        // stage being emitted, so an image stored in the vertex stage and loaded in the fragment
        // stage arrives here as `coherent writeonly g_image` and `coherent readonly g_image` -
        // one name, two spellings, which is exactly the pair Adreno merges. Those declarations

        // IMAGE_READONLY_ALIAS_PREFIX, writeonly -> IMAGE_WRITEONLY_ALIAS_PREFIX) and with
        // nothing but the identifier changed. Stages that agree still reach the same alias and
        // stay merged, so this costs no shader an extra image uniform.

        // The declarations this pass still leaves untouched keep their names: one carrying BOTH
        // readonly and writeonly (a spelling no access analysis produces, so it came from the
        // application and is identical everywhere), and one carrying NEITHER, which is legal only
        // for the r32f/r32i/r32ui formats and is likewise spelled the same in every stage.

        // guarantees a write through one image variable is visible to a read through a DIFFERENT

        // variable and a read of another it has no reason to believe alias, and is free to serve
        // the read from before the write - which is what advanced-memory-order's store/load/

        //     was made on demand by ClaimParsedShader): freed here in full, exactly like a
        //     CAS loser and for the same reason - the handoff is their only owner. This

        //     MISSED L1c and therefore stored its parse): NOT freed here. The winner branch
        //     returns a COPY of ShaderCompileTask::artifacts.shader and the node never

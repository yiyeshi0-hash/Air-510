// The invariant every backend memo keyed on a state object now rests on: a heap
// ADDRESS is not an identity, a lifetime id is.
//
// DirectVulkan memoises resolved vertex bindings per VertexArrayObject and folds
// the bound BufferObject's identity into the content hash that validates them.
// Both used to be heap addresses, and the allocator hands a freed address
// straight back: a VAO and a vertex buffer destroyed and immediately recreated
// under a byte-identical attribute layout reproduced BOTH the memo key and the
// validating hash, so the new draw fetched the destroyed buffer's GPU slice.
// GetLifetimeId() is what makes that impossible, so it is worth a test that
// needs no GPU, no context and no driver - only the allocator.
//
// The test does not simulate reuse; it waits for the real allocator to do it
// (which a LIFO free-list does on the very next allocation) and then asserts the
// id differs. If the allocator never repeats an address the run proves nothing,
// and the case says so with a skip rather than passing quietly.
